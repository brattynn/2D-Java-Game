# Java 2D Game Project

## 📌 Overview
This is a simple **2D Java game project** created as a learning exercise.  
Right now the project contains the basic structure for a game loop and a window system written in Java using **AWT** and **Swing**.

The goal of this project is to progressively build a small 2D game while learning:
- Game loops
- Rendering with `Canvas`
- Timing & FPS control
- Event handling
- Object management
- Basic game design concepts

This project is currently in an early stage and will expand over time.

## 🚀 Features (Current)
- Basic window creation using a custom `Window` class
- `Game` class that extends `Canvas` for rendering
- Beginning structure of a **fixed-tick game loop**
- Placeholder `tick()` and `render()` methods
- Runnable setup for multithreaded game execution

---

## 🎯 Planned Features
- Player movement
- Basic enemies
- Collision detection
- Graphics rendering
- Asset loading (sprites, textures)
- Sound effects and music
- Scoring system
- Start/pause game states

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts
- **Java 21**
- **AWT / Swing**
- **Canvas rendering**
- **Game loop timing** (60 ticks per second target)
- **Object-oriented design**
